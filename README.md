# Number Guessing Game

This Python script implements a simple number guessing game. The user is prompted to enter a range (lower and upper bounds), and the program generates a random number within that range. The user then has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

## Dependencies

- **random**: Used to generate random numbers.
- **math**: Provides mathematical functions.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the lower and upper bounds of the range when prompted.
3. The program will inform you of the maximum number of attempts you have based on the range.
4. Guess the number within the specified range.
5. You will receive feedback on whether your guess is too large, too small, out of range, or correct.
6. Continue guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
